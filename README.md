Initialize the swarm Xi (I =1,2,3,â€¦....,n)
Initialize cmax,cmin, and maximum number of iterations calculate the
fitness of each search agent
T= the best search agent
While (l < Max number of iterations)
 For each search agent
 Normolizes the distance between grasshoppers in udate the
position of current search agent by the equation bring the
search agent back if it goes outside the boudaries
 End for
 Udate T if there is a better solution
 L = l+1
